Main Training Script for Luxembourgish Fine-Tuning

Orchestrates the complete training pipeline for single-speaker Luxembourgish TTS.

Training Flow:
1. Pre-Training Setup:
   - Extract single speaker embedding [510, 1, 256] from reference Luxembourgish audio
   - Cache embedding to disk (reused for all 32k samples)
   - Extract F0 and durations for all samples (optional: cache to disk)
   - Verify data alignment: 28,800 train + 3,200 test samples

2. Model Initialization:
   - Load TrainableKModel from base_model/kokoro-v1_0.pth (312 MB, 82M params)
   - Handle 'module.' prefix from DataParallel save
   - Option to freeze BERT (12 layers, ~half the model) for faster training
   - Move to GPU and set to training mode

3. Data Loading:
   - Initialize LuxembourgishDataset for train/test splits
   - Create DataLoaders with collate function for variable-length sequences
   - Batch size: 4-8 (limited by memory due to [510, 1, 256] embeddings per sample)
   - Workers: 4-8 for parallel data loading

4. Training Loop (per epoch):
   - For each batch:
     a. Phonemize text with misaki.lb.LBG2P() → input_ids (max 510 tokens)
     b. Forward pass: model(input_ids, speaker_embedding) → audio, duration, F0
     c. Compute losses: duration loss + F0 loss + reconstruction loss
     d. Backward pass and optimizer step
     e. Log: loss values, gradient norms, learning rate
   
5. Validation (per epoch):
   - Evaluate on 3,200 test samples
   - Generate sample audio for qualitative assessment
   - Compute validation losses (no gradient updates)
   - Early stopping based on validation loss

6. Checkpointing:
   - Save model state every N epochs to checkpoints/
   - Save best model based on validation loss
   - Include: model weights, optimizer state, epoch number, config

7. Post-Training:
   - Load best checkpoint
   - Generate test samples for Luxembourgish voice quality assessment
   - Export trained model for inference via kokoro.pipeline.KPipeline(lang_code='l')

Training configuration:
- Epochs: 50-100 (monitor validation loss for early stopping)
- Learning rate: 1e-4 (Adam/AdamW)
- Gradient clipping: 1.0 (prevent explosion)
- Loss weights: duration=1.0, F0=0.5, reconstruction=1.0
- Freeze BERT: Configurable (faster training, may reduce quality)

Output: Fine-tuned Luxembourgish single-speaker TTS model compatible with Kokoro pipeline.
