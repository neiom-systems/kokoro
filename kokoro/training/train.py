Training orchestration blueprint.

This script will eventually wire together the dataset, model, losses, and optimiser to
fine-tune Kokoro on the Luxembourgish corpus. Before coding, capture the control flow
and key design decisions so implementation is straightforward.

High-level flow
---------------
1. **Initialisation**
   - Load `TrainingConfig` (see `config.py`) and set random seeds.
   - Instantiate the Luxembourgish voice table via `speaker_encoder` utilities.
   - Build `TrainableKModel`, optionally freezing ALBERT/text encoder layers based on
     config.
   - Prepare optimiser parameter groups (separate LR for voice table vs. rest) and the
     chosen scheduler.
   - Set up AMP scaler, gradient clipping threshold, and logging backends (tensorboard,
     wandb, plain CSVâ€”pick one).

2. **Data pipelines**
   - Create `LuxembourgishDataset` instances for train/val splits with cached features.
   - Wrap them in `DataLoader`s with custom `collate_fn`, `pin_memory=True`, and the
     configured number of workers.
   - Sanity-check a batch: verify phoneme lengths, duration sums, mel shapes, and the
     selected voice rows.

3. **Training loop**
   - For each epoch:
       a. Optionally unfreeze additional submodules according to the freeze schedule.
       b. Iterate over training batches:
            - Move tensors to device.
            - Call `model.forward(batch, use_teacher_durations=epoch < tf_epochs, ...)`.
            - Compute individual losses via `losses.compute(...)`, aggregate weighted sum.
            - Backpropagate with AMP, apply gradient clipping, and step optimiser.
            - Log metrics every `log_interval`.
       c. Run validation without gradient updates; report losses and, periodically,
          synthesize a few fixed sentences for qualitative review.
       d. Step scheduler based on policy (per-step or per-epoch).
       e. Checkpoint on improvement (best validation STFT) and keep periodic snapshots.

4. **Post-training**
   - Save the final fine-tuned checkpoint (`model_state_dict`, `optimizer`, `config`).
   - Export the learned voice table to `voices/lb_max.pt` so inference can load it via `voice="lb_max"`.
   - Dump evaluation artefacts (loss curves, audio samples, JSON summary).

Operational considerations
-------------------------
- Implement a robust resume mechanism (load checkpoint, restore scheduler/scaler state).
- Handle gradient accumulation if the effective batch size is too small.
- Support multi-GPU (DDP) down the line; keep data loaders and logging compatible.
- Include guardrails: detect NaNs, exploding losses, misaligned durations.

Once this plan is stable, translate each section into executable code with clear hooks
for experimentation.
