"""
Design skeleton for the Luxembourgish fine-tuning pipeline.

Nothing in this package is executable yet—each module currently stores design notes.
Once we implement the concrete classes/functions, re-export them here (and populate
``__all__``) so that downstream code can do ``from kokoro.training import …`` safely.

While prototyping, keep imports disabled to avoid AttributeErrors from the doc-only
modules.
