Speaker Embedding Extraction for Single-Speaker Luxembourgish Voice

Extracts position-specific speaker embeddings matching Kokoro's format.

Key requirement from BASE_MODEL_ANALYSIS.md:
- Voice files are [510, 1, 256] shape - NOT a single [1, 256] vector
- Each position in the 510-token sequence has its own 256-dim speaker embedding
- This allows position-dependent speaker conditioning during generation

Responsibilities:
1. Load reference audio from Luxembourgish corpus (e.g., representative sample)
2. Use pretrained speaker encoder (WavLM-base or HuBERT) to extract embeddings
3. Generate [510, 1, 256] tensor: 510 position-specific 256-dim embeddings
4. Cache this embedding to reuse for all 32k training samples (single speaker)
5. Match the format of base_model/voices/*.pt files (values: meanâ‰ˆ0, range [-1.5, 1.8])

Output: One [510, 1, 256] tensor used for all Luxembourgish samples during training.
